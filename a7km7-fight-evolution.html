                            <p> Occam's razor. For a different answer than most here. Evolution. Humans evolved large brains and communities as hunter gatherers. Notice the hunting part. We also evolved around cooking, as a greater amount of nutrients are released when food is cooked. It also meant we did not need as strong of a mandible since cooked meat is easier to chew than raw. Also, I don't know how speech evolved, but assuming that it was partly to help with hunting is not a big step. Humans need the some of the high density Have you ever wanted to play Ark on a server that you won’t get wiped from the planet on? Perhaps you want one where it doesn’t wipe every two weeks. Here at Horizon gaming we offer a PvE with Tribe wars available , a close community that’s friendly and is sure to help you out if you need anything, advanced rates such as 4x taming,4x harvesting, 4x xp gain, as well as 8x breeding so, you don’t spend hours doing tedious tasks. We also run mods such as S+ and Classic Flyers 
It just gets so tired getting entangled with people. I doubt if I have the right to love someone, say 'I love you', and hold their hand. I'm now terrified to get close to people because I know all I'll give them is misunderstandings and some bottles of hurt. I just don't want to get close to anyone. I'm a monster and I hurt and disappoint everyone- my parents, my teacher, my friends etc. I disappoint everyone due to my lack of ability to 'get things done', and I hurt them with some words. So I was reading through the manga (which is even better than I remembered!) and I noticed gokus got some pretty big personality changes, specifically in his approach to fighting in dbz. So Im interested in what you guys think. Its gonna be a little long but here we go: Saiyan Saga: Here goku is the definition of a wide eyed underdog. He has to go above and beyond to even have a chance. He also seemed a lot less battle focused than he is now, even telling piccolo that hes more scared than excit. This is hopefully a little more entertaining and will make the framed story telling a little more obvious as to why i am taking this approach. I must thank my u/BetsyCro (aka Wife), u/mobadder, u/HamsterIV, and u/WREN_PL for their feedback and helping me improve the story. Rogues ------------------------------------------------------- Wiki (https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/wiki/series/strangers_in_our_midst) Part 1 (https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/963bbq/rogues_part_1/). I have a problem. I spend a lot of my free time thinking about sexual strategy, and the future of the human race. My issue is that I've put a lot of thought into it, and I've read a lot of interesting comments, articles and books on the subject, but there is no real forum in which I can discuss these ideas. Topics of the evolution of mankind are not things normal people get into passionate arguments over. /r/theredpill, which is where you would think such discussion belongs, is not really. Have you ever wanted to play Ark on a server that you won’t get wiped from the planet on, while still having the vanilla Ark experience? Perhaps you want one where it doesn’t wipe every two weeks.

It's hard to believe i've been playing SW for over 3 years. Im mainly writing this as a reminder to myself to actually quit, SW is probably the biggest addiction of my life. I've enjoyed my time in the game, if it was just the game though, I think the title would have read 4 months. Ultimately it's the community that made SW great, and Com2us just happened to luck out in that regard. After talking with lots of long term big name players, I think the consensus has been reached. We are all/most. The Nissan GT-R and the Chevrolet Corvette Z06 are extremely different go-fast animals, from the firepower department to the cabin accommodation. However. The Nova Evolution Advanced Dreadnought The Nova-E, as the Sabre Frigates and the Poseidon heavy carriers , was one of the programs springed from the lessons </p>
