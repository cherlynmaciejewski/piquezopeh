I have a Lenovo IdeaPad Z510-b Laptop which I intended to Hackintosh it. and this is my first one so I'm pretty newbie as they say. The installation process has been successful, The OS boots up perfectly and I can do basic operations.(MacOs High Sierra 10.13 (17A405)) BUT I have some driver issues I hope you can help me fix.( I have screwed things up 3 times and have had to re install it again mostly on trying to fix Nvidia/intel graphic) here I'll give you info AFA I can/know; So, I've been trying to install linux on this light cheap laptop of mine that came preinstalled with windows.

After a lot of attempts I've finally found the issue, my computer only boots from EFI (I can't access BIOS), so I had to change the settings in Rusfus, easy as that.

Several weeks ago I received my X1 Carbon WQHD. I've discussed many of my impressions in both my original delivery thread as well as responding to other questions posted here as I've found time. This is a more formal review. My unit is configured with an i5-7300U processor, 16GB RAM, 1TB SSD, WQHD screen. No infrared camera or WWAN. It is attached to the Thinkpad Thunderbolt 3 dock, and to that I have a single Dell P2715q 4k monitor.
